Determining which Boolean laws to apply at each stage was one of the most difficult tasks, particularly when dealing with expressions that simplify using XOR, such as B'C + BC'. It was challenging to properly group terms and keep track of them without missing anything, and it wasn't always evident when the expression was completely simplified. There was more pressure to make sure the circuit would continue to operate as intended when the logic was translated into actual behavior.
